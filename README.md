Cryptid
---
This repository contains all the libraries and demos for the Cryptid identification system.

Cryptid is the next generation of identification. Current identification methods such as state issued driver's licenses are insecure and easily tampered with. Cryptid eliminates the possibility of counterfeit identification by adding factors of identification and encryption that is backed by a distributed, global network.
