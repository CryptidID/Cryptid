Cryptid
---
This repository contains all the libraries and demos for the Cryptid identification system.

Cryptid is the next generation of identification. Current identification methods such as state issued driver's licenses are insecure and easily tampered with. Cryptid eliminates the possibility of counterfeit identification by adding factors of identification and encryption that is backed by a distributed, global network.

See [cryptid.xyz](http://cryptid.xyz/) for more information!

Current State
---
Currently Cryptid is built ontop of the Factom Blockchain. This service was chosen as the project was created during the Borderless Block Party hackathon and Factom was a company supporting the event. For the future of Cryptid, other platforms are being researched.

The downside to using Factom is that is currently in its very early stages, meaning Factom currency may be difficult to obtain.
